# üîß **Skip Shell Issues - Run Diagnosis Now**

## **The shell errors are NOT the problem!** 
Those are just macOS asking you to switch from bash to zsh. Let's ignore that and focus on diagnosing your AWS white screen issue.

---

## **Step 1: Find Your Koda Project Directory**

First, you need to navigate to where your Koda project files are located:

```bash
# Find your project (replace with your actual path)
cd ~/Desktop/koda-project
# OR
cd ~/Documents/koda-project  
# OR wherever you have your Koda files
```

**üí° Tip:** Look for the folder that contains `App.tsx`, `package.json`, and the `components` folder.

---

## **Step 2: Verify You're in the Right Place**

Once you think you're in the right directory, verify by running:

```bash
ls -la
```

**‚úÖ You should see these files:**
- `App.tsx`
- `package.json` 
- `components/` folder
- `diagnose-aws-deployment.sh`

**‚ùå If you don't see these files,** you're in the wrong directory.

---

## **Step 3: Run the Diagnostic Script**

Once you're in the correct directory:

```bash
chmod +x diagnose-aws-deployment.sh
./diagnose-aws-deployment.sh
```

## **Alternative: Quick Manual Test**

If you're still having trouble with the script, let's do a quick manual test right now:

### **Test #1: Open Your Site**
Go to: **https://koda.kocreators.com/** in your browser

**What do you see?**
- ‚úÖ **Koda logo generator loads** = Your site works!
- ‚ùå **White/blank screen** = CloudFront error pages issue
- ‚ùå **Error page** = DNS or SSL issue

### **Test #2: Try Index Direct**  
Go to: **https://koda.kocreators.com/index.html**

**If this works but Test #1 doesn't:**
‚Üí **CONFIRMED:** You need CloudFront error pages (most common fix)

### **Test #3: Check Browser Console**
1. **Press F12** on your keyboard
2. **Click "Console" tab**  
3. **Look for red error messages**

---

## **Most Likely Fix (90% chance):**

Your issue is probably missing **CloudFront Error Pages**. Here's the quick fix:

### **AWS Console Fix:**
1. **Go to:** AWS CloudFront Console
2. **Find:** Your distribution for `koda.kocreators.com`
3. **Click:** "Error Pages" tab
4. **Add:** Custom Error Response
   - **HTTP Error Code:** `403`
   - **Response Page Path:** `/koda/index.html`  
   - **HTTP Response Code:** `200`
5. **Add:** Another Custom Error Response
   - **HTTP Error Code:** `404`
   - **Response Page Path:** `/koda/index.html`
   - **HTTP Response Code:** `200`
6. **Wait:** 10-15 minutes for CloudFront to update
7. **Test:** Your site again

## **If You're Still Having Directory Issues:**

Just tell me:
1. **What folder is your Koda project in?** (e.g., Desktop, Documents, etc.)
