# 🔍 **2-Minute Browser Test** (Do This First!)

Before running any scripts, do this quick test to confirm the issue:

## **Step 1: Test These URLs**

Open these in your browser **right now**:

1. **https://koda.kocreators.com/**
   - Expected: Your Koda app
   - If white screen: CloudFront error pages issue ❌

2. **https://koda.kocreators.com/index.html**
   - Expected: Same as above
   - If this works but #1 doesn't: Confirms error pages fix needed ✅
   - If this also fails: S3 file upload issue ❌

## **Step 2: Check Browser Console**

1. **Press F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
2. **Click "Console" tab**
3. **Look for red error messages**

Common errors you might see:
- `Failed to load resource` → Missing files
- `CORS error` → API configuration issue  
- `404 Not Found` → File structure issue

## **Step 3: Check Network Tab**

1. **In dev tools, click "Network" tab**
2. **Refresh the page (F5)**
3. **Look for red/failed requests**

Files that should load:
- ✅ `index.html` (200 status)
- ✅ `main-[hash].js` (200 status) 
- ✅ `main-[hash].css` (200 status)

## **Quick Diagnosis:**

**If #1 fails but #2 works:**
→ **Fix:** Add CloudFront error pages (90% chance this is it!)

**If both #1 and #2 fail:**
→ **Fix:** Check S3 file upload structure

**If both work but app doesn't function:**
→ **Fix:** Check console errors (likely API key issue)

---

## **Most Likely Solution:**

Go to **AWS CloudFront Console** and add these error pages:

- **403 Error** → Redirect to `/koda/index.html` → Response Code 200
- **404 Error** → Redirect to `/koda/index.html` → Response Code 200

Then wait 10 minutes and test again! 🎉
