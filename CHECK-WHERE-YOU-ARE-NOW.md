# 📍 **CHECK WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW**

## **First, let's see exactly where you are and what's there:**

```bash
pwd
```

```bash
ls -la | head -10
```

**Based on your file structure, you should see:**
- ✅ App.tsx
- ✅ package.json  
- ✅ components/
- ✅ styles/
- ✅ vite.config.ts

---

## **If you see those files, you're in the RIGHT PLACE!**

**Just run these commands directly:**
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://koda-logo-generator-jordanbremond-2025/koda/ --delete
```

---

## **If you DON'T see those files, but see a bunch of .md files:**

You might be in a parent directory. Try:
```bash
ls -la */
```

This will show subdirectories that might contain your project.

## **🎯 Your file structure shows everything is ready - we just need to confirm location and deploy!**
