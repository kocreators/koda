# 📍 **WHERE AM I NOW? - SIMPLE DIAGNOSTIC**

## **Run this to see your current location:**

```bash
pwd && echo "--- Files here ---" && ls -la
```

**This shows:**
- Your current directory path
- All files in your current location

---

## **If you DON'T see App.tsx, package.json, and components/ folder:**

### **Find your project:**
```bash
find ~ -name "App.tsx" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

### **Navigate to the directory that contains App.tsx:**
```bash
cd [PATH_FROM_ABOVE_COMMAND]
```

**Example:**
If the find command shows `/home/cloudshell-user/my-koda-project/App.tsx`
Then run: `cd /home/cloudshell-user/my-koda-project`

---

## **If you DO see App.tsx, package.json, components/ folder:**

✅ **You're in the right place! Now run:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build  
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://koda-logo-generator-jordanbremond-2025/koda/ --delete
```

---

## **🎯 The Problem:**
You have all the right files, you just need to be in the directory that contains them when you run the npm commands. The `pwd` and `ls` commands above will show you exactly where you are and what's there.
