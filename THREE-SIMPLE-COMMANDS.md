# 🎯 **JUST RUN THESE 3 COMMANDS**

## **Copy each line EXACTLY (without the $ symbol):**

### **Command 1:**
```
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json dist
```
**Press Enter and wait for it to finish**

### **Command 2:**
```  
npm install
```
**Press Enter and wait for packages to install (may take 1-2 minutes)**

### **Command 3:**
```
npm run dev
```
**Press Enter and your app will start**

---

## **🌐 Then open your browser:**
**Go to:** http://localhost:5173/koda/

---

## **✅ That's it!** 
Your Koda logo generator should now be running locally with:
- Design Prompt Builder

## **🔧 Only if you get errors:**

### **If Command 2 fails, replace it with:**
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### **If Command 3 shows port busy:**
```
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```
*Then visit: http://localhost:3000/koda/*
