# 🎯 **FIND YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY FIRST**

## **Step 1: Find Your Project**
Your project has all the files, but you need to navigate to it first. Try these commands:

### **Option A: Search for your project directory**
```bash
find ~ -name "App.tsx" -type f 2>/dev/null
```
This will show you the path to your App.tsx file.

### **Option B: Search for package.json**
```bash
find ~ -name "package.json" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```
This will show you directories with package.json files.

### **Option C: List all directories to find your project**
```bash
ls -la ~/
```
Look for a directory name related to your project (might be `koda`, `koda-project`, etc.)

## **Step 2: Navigate to Your Project**
Once you find your project directory, navigate to it:

### **If your project is in a subdirectory, navigate there:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### **Common project locations to check:**
```bash
# Check if it's in a koda directory
ls -la ~/koda*/

# Check if it's in current working directories
ls -la ~/*/App.tsx

# Check if it's in a projects folder
ls -la ~/projects/
```

## **Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place**
Once you navigate to your project directory, verify with:
```bash
pwd
ls -la App.tsx package.json
```

**You should see:**
- Your current directory path
- App.tsx file details
- package.json file details

## **Step 4: Now Run the Setup Commands**
Only after you're in the correct project directory:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json dist
npm install
npm run dev
```

# 🚀 **QUICK SOLUTION**

## **Method 1: One command to find and setup**
```bash
cd $(find ~ -name "App.tsx" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs dirname) && pwd && ls -la package.json && npm install
```

## **Method 2: Manual navigation**
1. **Find project:** `find ~ -name "App.tsx" 2>/dev/null`
2. **Navigate:** `cd /path/shown/from/above`  
3. **Verify:** `ls -la package.json`
4. **Install:** `npm install`

# 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **After finding your project:**
```
/home/cloudshell-user/your-project-name
```

### **After `ls -la package.json`:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Aug 10 00:00 package.json
```

### **After `npm install`:**
```
added 234 packages, and audited 235 packages in 15s
```

**🔍 The key is: You MUST be in the directory that contains package.json before running npm commands!**
