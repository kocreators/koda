# üõ†Ô∏è **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

## **Problem: "npm install" shows errors**

### **If you see "ERESOLVE" errors, try this instead:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### **If you see "permission denied" errors:**
```bash
sudo npm install
```

---

## **Problem: "npm run dev" doesn't work**

### **Try this version:**
```bash
npx vite dev --port 8080
```

### **Or this version:**
```bash
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

---

## **Problem: Browser shows blank page**

### **Check if the server is actually running:**
- Look for "VITE ready" message in your terminal
- Make sure you're visiting the EXACT URL shown (including /koda/ at the end)

### **Try this URL format:**
- If it shows `http://localhost:8080/koda/`, visit that EXACT URL
- If it shows a different port, use that port number

---

## **Problem: Command does nothing / no output**

### **Make sure you're pressing Enter after typing each command**

### **If still nothing happens, try:**
```bash
echo "I'm in the right place" && ls -la package.json
```

**This should show you're in the right directory and that package.json exists.**

## **‚úÖ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:**

### **After npm install:**
```
added 234 packages in 15s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

### **After npm run dev:**
```
VITE v6.0.1  ready in 500ms
‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:8080/koda/
```

### **In your browser:**
- You see "KODA" title in teal/green
- You see "AI LOGO GENERATOR" subtitle  
- You see a form with dropdowns for Business Type, Industry, etc.
- Everything looks professional and styled

**üéâ That means it's working perfectly!**
