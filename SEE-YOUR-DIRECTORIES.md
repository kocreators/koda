# ðŸ‘€ **SEE YOUR DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**

## **First, let's see what's in your home directory:**

```bash
ls -la ~
```

**This shows all folders in your home directory.**

---

## **Look for any folder that might contain your project:**

Common names might be:
- `koda-project/`
- `koda-logo-generator/` 
- `my-project/`
- `workspace/`
- `projects/`

---

## **If you see a likely folder, check inside it:**

**Example - if you see a folder called `my-project`:**
```bash
ls -la ~/my-project
```

**Look for:**
- âœ… App.tsx
- âœ… package.json
- âœ… components/

---

## **Once you find the right folder, navigate there:**
```bash
cd ~/[folder-name]
```

**Example:**
```bash
cd ~/my-project
```

---

## **Or use this shortcut to check multiple common locations:**
```bash
for dir in koda* project* workspace projects; do
  if [ -d ~/$dir ]; then
    echo "Found directory: ~/$dir"
    ls -la ~/$dir | head -5
    echo "---"
  fi
done
```

**ðŸŽ¯ This will show you any directories that might contain your project!**
