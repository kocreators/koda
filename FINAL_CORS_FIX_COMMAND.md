# 🔧 FINAL CORS FIX - RUN THIS NOW

## **The Problem:**
Your Koda app has CORS errors because the HTML is trying to load assets from CloudFront while being served from your custom domain.

## **🚀 ONE COMMAND TO FIX EVERYTHING:**

```bash
chmod +x fix-cors-and-deploy.sh && ./fix-cors-and-deploy.sh
```

## **What This Does:**
1. ✅ Updates vite.config.ts to use `base: '/'` (custom domain)
2. ✅ Clean builds with correct asset paths
3. ✅ Deploys to S3 root (not /koda/ subfolder)
4. ✅ Clears CloudFront cache
5. ✅ Tests the deployment

## **Expected Output:**
```
✅ Found App.tsx - in correct directory
✅ Vite config correct for custom domain (base: '/')
✅ Asset paths look correct (relative paths)
✅ Deployed to S3!
🌟 SUCCESS! Your Koda app should now work at:
🌐 https://koda.kocreators.com
```

## **🧪 Test After Deployment:**
1. Open: https://koda.kocreators.com
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for CORS errors (should be NONE)
4. Verify KODA app loads properly

## **🎯 Success Indicators:**
- ✅ No "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" errors
- ✅ KODA title displays in teal
- ✅ All form inputs work
- ✅ Generate button functional
- ✅ Three-step workflow works

## **If Still Not Working:**
Wait 5-10 minutes for CloudFront cache to clear, then test again.

**Your CORS issue will be fixed and Koda will work perfectly! 🎉**
