# ‚ö° **INSTANT FIX - Copy & Paste This**

Ignore the shell errors! Here's the fastest way to fix your white screen:

---

## **Option 1: Find Your Project (Copy/Paste)**

```bash
# Find your Koda project
find ~ -name "App.tsx" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | head -1
```

This will show you the path to your Koda project. Then:

```bash
# Replace /path/to/your/project with the path from above
cd /path/to/your/project
ls -la | grep diagnose
chmod +x diagnose-aws-deployment.sh
./diagnose-aws-deployment.sh
```

   - Works fine?

2. **What happens when you visit https://koda.kocreators.com/index.html?**
   - Same as above?

## **Most Likely Solution:**

**90% chance:** Your files are uploaded correctly, but CloudFront doesn't know to serve `/koda/index.html` when someone visits the root URL. The error pages fix above tells CloudFront: "When you get a 404/403 error, redirect to the actual index file."

**This is the #1 most common issue with SPAs on AWS!** üöÄ
