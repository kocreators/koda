# 🎯 **YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE! LET'S DO THIS STEP BY STEP**

## **Step 1: First, just check you can see your files**
Type this and press Enter:
```bash
ls package.json App.tsx
```

**You should see:**
```
App.tsx  package.json
```

---

## **Step 2: Install the project dependencies**
Type this and press Enter:
```bash
npm install
```

**This might take 1-2 minutes. You should see lots of text scrolling by, ending with something like:**
```
added 234 packages, and audited 235 packages in 15s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

**⚠️ If you see any ERRORS (not warnings), let me know what they say.**

---

## **Step 3: Start the development server**
After Step 2 finishes successfully, type this and press Enter:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**You should see:**
```
VITE v6.0.1  ready in 500ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:8080/koda/
```

**🌐 Then open that URL in your browser!**

## **🚨 IMPORTANT:**
- **Do these ONE AT A TIME**
- **Wait for each command to finish before typing the next one**
- **Tell me if ANY command gives you an error message**
- **Don't worry about warnings - only ERRORS matter**
