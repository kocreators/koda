# ⚡ **BYPASS NAVIGATION - DEPLOY NOW**

## **One command to check location and deploy if ready:**

```bash
if [ -f "App.tsx" ] && [ -f "package.json" ]; then echo "✅ Deploying from current directory..." && npm install && npm run build && aws s3 sync dist/ s3://koda-logo-generator-jordanbremond-2025/koda/ --delete && echo "🎉 Deployment complete!"; else echo "❌ App.tsx not found in current directory. Run 'ls -la' to see what's here."; fi
```

**This single command will:**
1. ✅ Check if you're in the right place
2. 📦 Install dependencies
3. 🔨 Build your app  
4. 🚀 Deploy to S3
5. ✅ Confirm success

---

## **Expected output if successful:**
```
✅ Deploying from current directory...
npm WARN deprecated [some warnings - ignore these]
added 234 packages in 15s
✓ built in 3.45s
upload: dist/index.html to s3://koda-logo-generator-jordanbremond-2025/koda/index.html
upload: dist/assets/index-abc123.js to s3://...
🎉 Deployment complete!
```

---

## **If it says "App.tsx not found":**
```bash
ls -la
```

**Look for a subdirectory that contains your project, then:**
```bash
cd [directory-name]
```

**Then run the deployment command again.**
