# üéØ **YOU'RE IN AWS CLOUDSHELL - PERFECT PLACE TO BE!**

## **The Problem:** 
You're running npm commands from `/home/cloudshell-user/` (home directory)  
But your project files are in a subdirectory somewhere.

## **The Solution - Find Your Project Directory:**

### **Step 1: List what's in your current directory**
```bash
ls -la
```
Look for a folder that contains your Koda project.

### **Step 2: Navigate to your project directory**
Your project files are likely in one of these locations:
```bash
# Try these common directory names:
cd koda-ai-logo-generator
# OR
cd koda  
# OR
cd my-project
# OR
cd koda-project
```

### **Step 3: Verify you're in the right place**
After navigating, check if you can see your files:
```bash
ls -la App.tsx package.json
```

**You should see:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Aug 10 00:00 App.tsx
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5678 Aug 10 00:00 package.json
```

### **Step 4: Install and run**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## **üîç AUTOMATED FINDER (if manual doesn't work):**

### **Find your project automatically:**
```bash
find . -name "package.json" -type f | grep -v node_modules
```

### **Navigate to the directory that shows up:**
```bash
cd [directory-from-above-without-package.json]
```

**Example:** If it shows `./koda-project/package.json`, then run:
```bash
cd koda-project
```

---

## **‚ö° ONE-COMMAND SOLUTION:**
```bash
cd $(find . -name "package.json" -type f | grep -v node_modules | head -1 | xargs dirname) && pwd && npm install && npm run dev
```

This will:
1. Find your project directory
2. Navigate to it  
3. Show where you are
4. Install dependencies
5. Start development server

## **‚úÖ SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

### **After finding your directory:**
```bash
pwd
# Should show something like: /home/cloudshell-user/koda-project
```

### **After npm install:**
```
added 234 packages, and audited 235 packages in 15s

```

### **After npm run dev:**
```
VITE v6.0.1  ready in 500ms
